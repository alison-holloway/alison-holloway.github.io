- **Complete Documentation Sets:** Delivered comprehensive documentation for multiple Oracle Linux products, consistently meeting aggressive release deadlines while maintaining high quality standards
- **Technical Innovation:** Designed and implemented automated deployment scripts using Terraform and Ansible, which were later adopted by Oracle Support teams to improve internal testing efficiency
- **Documentation Modernization:** Successfully migrated documentation source code from legacy Subversion/DocBook to Git/DITA, modernizing workflows and significantly reducing maintenance overhead
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Partnered with engineering teams to test features during development, identifying improvements and raising defects early in the product lifecycle
- **Content Management:** Designed and managed hosting of documentation sets on docs.oracle.com using Oracle APEX
- **Mentorship Excellence:** Recognized as a trusted mentor for new writers, fostering stronger cross-team relationships and raising content quality standards across the organization

**Senior Technical Writer (1993-2013)**

Produced high-quality documentation for Oracle Database and Oracle Applications, including SQL*Plus and localization features. Notable accomplishments:

- **Global Knowledge Sharing:** Delivered presentations and hands-on training sessions at major international conferences including Oracle OpenWorld and PHP conferences in Germany and New York, increasing visibility and adoption of Oracle technologies
- **Training Material Development:** Created comprehensive training materials and customer-facing guides for technical audiences
- **Cross-Division Collaboration:** Successfully adapted to new technical domains by working closely with product teams across multiple Oracle divisions

## Technical Documentation Philosophy

I believe great technical documentation should be:

- **Accurate:** Technical precision is non-negotiable, especially for enterprise systems where configuration errors can have serious consequences
- **User-Centered:** Content must address real user needs and workflows, not just feature descriptions
- **Action-Oriented:** Every document should guide users to successfully complete their tasks with clear, sequential steps
- **Testable:** Documentation should be validated through hands-on testing in environments that mirror production use cases
- **Maintainable:** Well-structured, modular content that's easy to update as products evolve

## Approach to Technical Writing

My process combines technical expertise with user advocacy:

1. **Deep Technical Understanding:** I invest time in learning the technology hands-on, often creating test environments and deployment scripts to fully understand the user experience
2. **Engineering Collaboration:** I work closely with developers during the feature development cycle, not just at the end, to ensure accurate documentation and identify usability issues early
3. **Structured Content:** I leverage DITA XML and topic-based authoring to create modular, reusable content that scales across product families
4. **Continuous Improvement:** I regularly gather feedback from users, support teams, and field engineers to refine and enhance documentation

## Professional Development

**Education:**

- Master of Technology (Internet and Web Computing), RMIT, 2005
- Graduate Diploma in Internet and Web Computing (Distinction), RMIT, 2002

**Community Engagement:**
