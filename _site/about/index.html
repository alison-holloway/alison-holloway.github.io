<h2 id="technical-documentation-philosophy">Technical Documentation Philosophy</h2>

<p>I believe great technical documentation should be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Accurate:</strong> Technical precision is non-negotiable, especially for enterprise systems where configuration errors can have serious consequences</li>
  <li><strong>User-Centered:</strong> Content must address real user needs and workflows, not just feature descriptions</li>
  <li><strong>Action-Oriented:</strong> Every document should guide users to successfully complete their tasks with clear, sequential steps</li>
  <li><strong>Testable:</strong> Documentation should be validated through hands-on testing in environments that mirror production use cases</li>
  <li><strong>Maintainable:</strong> Well-structured, modular content that’s easy to update as products evolve</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="approach-to-technical-writing">Approach to Technical Writing</h2>

<p>My process combines technical expertise with user advocacy:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Deep Technical Understanding:</strong> I invest time in learning the technology hands-on, often creating test environments and deployment scripts to fully understand the user experience</li>
  <li><strong>Engineering Collaboration:</strong> I work closely with developers during the feature development cycle, not just at the end, to ensure accurate documentation and identify usability issues early</li>
  <li><strong>Structured Content:</strong> I leverage DITA XML and topic-based authoring to create modular, reusable content that scales across product families</li>
  <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> I regularly gather feedback from users, support teams, and field engineers to refine and enhance documentation</li>
</ol>
