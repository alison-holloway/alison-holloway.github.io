I designed and wrote the Oracle Cloud Native Environment (Oracle CNE) documentation from product concept to delivery. I was the sole writer for this project for most of it's long life. 

You can see the latest Release 1 documentation set at:

Release 2 was redesigned and rearchitected. This meant a whole new documentation set was required, where almost none of the Release 1 books could be reused. I designed the new documentation set in a structured way, using DITA data types. You can see this documentation set at:
